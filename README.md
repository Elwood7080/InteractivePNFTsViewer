Viewer for Interactive PNFTs

Why not create NFTs that talk to us? A PNFT is a Programmed NFT, and this type of PNFT interacts with the user. The technique is called Steganography and hides content in an image. The idea is to create interpretable hidden content in the image to make NFTs interactive, enrich them with various kinds of functions, etc. 

This software is just an example of how to view the content of PNFTs. You can start from these sources and the file with the description of the data format and develop a viewer or creator of PNFTs according to your needs.

Changelog
